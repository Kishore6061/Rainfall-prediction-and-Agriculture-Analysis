# Rainfall-prediction-and-Agriculture-Analysis
Steps to Execute the Project:

1. Install Required Libraries: Install Python, pip, and required libraries (Flask, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib).
2. Prepare Data Files: Create Excel files for rainfall data (data.csv.xlsx) and crops data (crops.xlsx).
3. Run the Application: Run the Flask application using python app.py.
4. Access the Application: Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.
5. Use the Application: Predict rainfall, get crop recommendations, and view data visualizations.

Tools and Methods Used:

1. Python: Programming language used for building the application.
2. Flask: Web framework used for creating the web application.
3. Pandas: Library used for data manipulation and analysis.
4. Scikit-learn: Library used for machine learning and model training.
5. Matplotlib: Library used for data visualization.
6. Excel: Used for storing and managing data files (xlsx format).
7. HTML/CSS: Used for creating the user interface and styling web pages.
8. JavaScript: Used for creating dynamic dropdown menus and API calls.

Method:

1. Machine Learning: Decision Tree Regressor model used for predicting rainfall.
2. Data Analysis: Data analysis techniques used for crop recommendations.
3. Data Visualization: Pie and bar charts used to display predicted monthly rainfall.
